## Automated Test Coverage

### âœ… Completed Tests

#### Landing Page (Unauthenticated)
- Landing page renders with correct content
- "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons are visible
- Theme toggle switches between light/dark mode
- Dark mode class applied to HTML element
- Feature cards display correctly

### ðŸ”„ Requires Manual Testing (Replit Auth)

These features require authenticated sessions and cannot be fully automated:

1. **Login Flow**
   - Replit Auth provider selection
   - OAuth callback handling
   - Session creation and persistence

2. **Authenticated Schedule Operations**
   - Employee CRUD operations
   - Time block creation and updates
   - Drag-and-drop transfers
   - Multi-user data isolation

## Security Test Scenarios

### âœ… Verified

1. **PATCH Endpoint Protection**
   - Cannot change userId via PATCH /api/employees/:id
   - Cannot change userId via PATCH /api/timeblocks/:id
   - Update schemas exclude userId field

2. **Employee Transfer Validation**
   - Can only transfer blocks to own employees
   - 403 error when transferring to other user's employees
   - employeeId ownership verified before update

3. **Authorization Checks**
   - All employee/timeblock endpoints require authentication
   - Ownership verified before update/delete operations
   - 404 returned for records owned by other users

### Manual Security Tests

1. **Cross-Tenant Isolation**
   - [ ] User A cannot see User B's employees
   - [ ] User A cannot modify User B's time blocks
   - [ ] API returns 404 for other users' resources

2. **Session Management**
   - [ ] Session expires after 1 week
   - [ ] Refresh token updates session
   - [ ] Logout clears session completely

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Page loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] API responses in < 500ms
- [ ] Smooth drag-and-drop (no jank)
- [ ] Database queries optimized (indexed lookups)

## Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Known Limitations

1. **Drag-and-Drop**: Requires mouse/touch - keyboard navigation not supported
2. **Time Slots**: Fixed 30-minute grid intervals
3. **Date Range**: Single day view only (no week/month views)
4. **Collaboration**: Real-time updates require page refresh
